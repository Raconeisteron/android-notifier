Android side:
 Main activity should give preferences:
  * Which events to notify about
  * Notification method
  * Start/stop service
  * Enable/disable service startup at boot

Desktop side:
 * Mac, Linux
 * Anyone willing to implement for windows?
 * Mac: Menu bar app
 * Linux: Gnome panel app
 * Preferences:
  * Actions when status changes:
   * Growl/gnome notification
   * Lower volume
   * Run application
  * Pair with device
  * Event type filtering? (already done on device, though, should they sync?)

Notification methods:
 * Wifi - UDP broadcast with serial number (so multiple devices can work on the same network)
 * Bluetooth - bluetooth sockets
 * USB - use debug bridge port forwarding or logcat (can we redistribute the ADB binary?)

Events to notify about:
 * Phone ring
 * (v2) Low battery
 * (v2) SMS/MMS

Security:
 * Encryption - pair device with desktop using shared key
 * Can't use TCP only - would require a fixed IP for the server on Wifi

Power efficiency:
 * Just sit idle or stop service if wifi+bluetooth+usb are all off
 * If one of them is on but no connection is made, retry every X seconds
