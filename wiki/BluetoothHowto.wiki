Please, follow these steps carefully to get bluetooth working.

 * Close Android Notifier Desktop if it is running (right-click tray icon -> Quit)
 * Pair your device with your computer using the Bluetooth Manager of your Operating System
 * Run Android Notifier Desktop again
 * Enable bluetooth in the preferences window if it's not enabled already (right-click tray icon -> Preferences...)
 * Click OK to close the preferences window
 * Send test notification from your device
 * Wait a couple seconds
 * If AND doesn't show a ping test notification, send test notification again

Bluetooth takes some time to send the first notifications but it'll be pretty quick after the first ones.

If you still don't get bluetooth notifications, feel free to create an issue on this project.
